==What is a MIP?==

MIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. A MIP is a design document providing information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for Bitcoin or its processes or environment. The MIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend MIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. The MIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the MIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

==MIP Types==

There are three kinds of MIP:

* A Standards Track MIP describes any change that affects most or all Bitcoin implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Bitcoin.
* An Informational MIP describes a Bitcoin design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Bitcoin community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational MIPs do not necessarily represent a Bitcoin community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational MIPs or follow their advice.
* A Process MIP describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process MIPs are like Standards Track MIPs but apply to areas other than the Bitcoin protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Bitcoin's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational MIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Bitcoin development. Any meta-MIP is also considered a Process MIP.

==MIP Work Flow==

The MIP process begins with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential MIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the MIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The MIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is MIP-able. Posting to the [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org] mailing list (and maybe the [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0 Development & Technical Discussion] forum) is the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a MIP is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing Bitcoin that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the Bitcoin community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Bitcoin is used. Small enhancements or patches often don't need standardisation between multiple projects; these don't need a MIP and should be injected into the relevant Bitcoin development work flow with a patch submission to the applicable Bitcoin issue tracker.

Once the champion has asked the Bitcoin community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft MIP should be presented to the [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev bitcoin-dev] mailing list. This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft MIP to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal. Following a discussion, the proposal should be sent to the bitcoin-dev list and the MIP editor with the draft MIP. This draft must be written in MIP style as described below, else it will be sent back without further regard until proper formatting rules are followed.

MIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both the initial idea and the MIP before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the MIP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page or git repository, etc. MIP authors should use their discretion here.

It is highly recommended that a single MIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the MIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your MIP into several well-focused ones.

The MIP editors assign MIP numbers and change their status. Please send all MIP-related email to the MIP editor, which is listed under [[#MIP_Editors|MIP Editors]] below. Also see [[#MIP_Editor_Responsibilities__Workflow|MIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow]]. The MIP editor reserves the right to reject MIP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad.

Authors MUST NOT self assign MIP numbers, but should use an alias such as "mip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins" which includes the author's name/nick and the MIP subject.

If the MIP editor approves, he will assign the MIP a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft", and add it to the MIPs git repository. The MIP editor will not unreasonably deny a MIP. Reasons for denying MIP status include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy. For a MIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

The MIP author may update the Draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts may also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

Standards Track MIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation. The MIP should be reviewed and accepted before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference implementation will aid people in studying the MIP. Standards Track MIPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch, or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

Once a MIP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted by the community, the status will be changed to "Final".

A MIP can also be assigned status "Deferred". The MIP author or editor can assign the MIP this status when no progress is being made on the MIP. Once a MIP is deferred, the MIP editor can re-assign it to draft status.

A MIP can also be "Rejected". Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact.

MIPs can also be superseded by a different MIP, rendering the original obsolete. This is intended for Informational MIPs, where version 2 of an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of MIPs are as follows:

<img src=mip-0001/process.png></img>

Some Informational and Process MIPs may also have a status of "Active" if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. MIP 1 (this MIP).

==What belongs in a successful MIP?==

Each MIP should have the following parts:

* Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the MIP, including the MIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.

* Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

* Copyright/public domain -- Each MIP must either be explicitly labelled as placed in the public domain (see this MIP as an example) or licensed under the Open Publication License.

* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Bitcoin platforms (Satoshi, BitcoinJ, bitcoin-js, libbitcoin).

* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for MIPs that want to change the Bitcoin protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the MIP solves. MIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

* The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

* Backwards Compatibility -- All MIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The MIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. MIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

* Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be completed before any MIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the MIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code.

* The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Bitcoin protocol.

==MIP Formats and Templates==

MIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown format.

===MIP Header Preamble===

Each MIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

<pre>
  MIP: <MIP number>
  Title: <MIP title>
  Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
* Discussions-To: <email address>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
  Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
* Post-History: <dates of postings to bitcoin mailing list>
* Replaces: <MIP number>
* Superseded-By: <MIP number>
* Resolution: <url>
</pre>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the MIP. The format of the Author header value must be

  Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

  Random J. User

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track MIPs only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web resource where the pronouncement about the MIP is made.

While a MIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the MIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the MIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the bitcoin email mailing lists.

The Type header specifies the type of MIP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

The Created header records the date that the MIP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new versions of the MIP are posted to bitcoin mailing lists. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

MIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the MIP numbers that this MIP depends on.

MIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a MIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the MIP that replaces the current document. The newer MIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the MIP that it rendered obsolete.

===Auxiliary Files===

MIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Image files should be included in a subdirectory for that MIP. Auxiliary files must be named MIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the MIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

==Transferring MIP Ownership==

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of MIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred MIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the MIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the MIP. We try to build consensus around a MIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing MIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a MIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the MIP editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the MIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

==MIP Editors==

The current MIP editor is Luke Dashjr who can be contacted at [[mailto:luke_mipeditor@dashjr.org|luke_mipeditor@dashjr.org]].

==MIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow==

The MIP editor subscribes to the Bitcoin development mailing list. All MIP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to luke_mipeditor@dashjr.org.

For each new MIP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the MIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Edit the MIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (for reST MIPs), code style (examples should match MIP 8 & 7).

If the MIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the MIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a "pull request" to the [https://github.com/bitcoin/mips bitcoin/mips] repository on GitHub where it may get further feedback.

The MIP editor will:

* Assign a MIP number (almost always just the next available number, but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141) in the pull request comments.

* Merge the pull request when the author is ready (allowing some time for further peer review).

* List the MIP in [[README.mediawiki]]

* Send email back to the MIP author with next steps (post to bitcoin-dev mailing list).

The MIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The MIP editors monitor MIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

==History==

This document was derived heavily from Python's PEP-0001. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the Bitcoin Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Bitcoin or the MIP process. Please direct all comments to the MIP editors or the Bitcoin development mailing list.

==Changelog==
